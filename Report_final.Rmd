# Data

The following analyses are based on a dataset of `r nrow(laenderfinanz)` rows and `r ncol(laenderfinanz)` columns.


# Some Visualizations

## Arrow Chart, 2018 vs. 1995

1995 vs. 2018 is an interesting comparison:

* In 1995, the East German federal states were included for the first time.
* 2018 is the most recent time in this dataset.
* There were massive shifts in same states.

```{r arrows, echo = TRUE}

df <- laenderfinanz %>%
  select(-Typ) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Jahr, values_from = Finanzausgleich)

ggplot(df, aes(x = `1995`, xend = `2018`,
               y = reorder(Bundesland, `2018`), yend = reorder(Bundesland, `2018`))) +
